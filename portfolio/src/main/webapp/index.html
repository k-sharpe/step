      <p>My name is Kendrick. I'm a sophomore now because I just found out I passed my spring semester classes! </p>
      <p>This is my STEP portfolio. I've got quite a few websites and projects out there, but this one is special because I made it from scratch.</p>

      <p>   In addition, I have a few cool things to share. First, </p>
      <p>Here's a picture of my dog, Karlos. </p>

      <p>Here's a picture I like that I took on a bike ride! </p>
      <img class="display-img" src="images/field.jpg" id="field" alt="Image of a field in San Jose"></img>
      <p>   Speaking of biking, I really like to go for bike rides.</p>
      <p>On Thursday before the 4 day memorial day weekend, I went for my longest ride ever.</p>
      <p>Can you guess how far it was (in miles!)?</p>

      <p>     My most recent personal project is a stock portfolio manager. 
        It's waiting to be worked on once the internship ends, and currently doesn't work! </p>
